<h2>Personal Website</h2>
<p>
This very webiste is one of my side projects. I had recenlty leanred how to use HTML and decided to create website that talks about what skills I can bring to the table. I implemented this website by using HTML 5 and internal CSS resources.

<h2>To-Do List</h2>
<p>
I've always had a to do list since I could remember. As a kid, I would receive these booklets every year where I was supposed to keep track of what to do like, Homework, Clubs, and so on ... but I never used them until middle school. Ever since then, I've always had a list of tasks that needed to be completed. This lead me to create my very own to-do list with the help of Java Swing. I am also in the process of connecting my google calander with my own To-List so that they are in sync.
