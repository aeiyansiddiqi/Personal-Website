<h2>Oh hi nice to meet you, my name is Aeiyan and yours is?</h2>
<p>
Hi, my name is Aeiyan Siddiqi and I am a 2nd year studnet at the University of Guelph studying Computer Science. I decided at the end of my 1st year to minor in mathamatics after seeing how useful having numerical formulas at the top of your head can be when trying to create a quick and easy solution in programming. 

I am currenlty looking to contribute my skills for a company over the summer and hopefuly in the process, I would like to further grow as a person. I would like to grow my technical skills but also my skills in collaboration and communication with my fellow workers. If given the chance, I wont let you and the company down.

<h2>Where it all Started...</h2>
<p>
I have been programming for the past 5 years now, it all started in grade 10 when decided to take a programming course of the first time. I would like to say that it went all smoothly and that I was a computer wiz but that was far from the case. I was struggling at the beggining and when it came time to decide wheather to take programming in grade 11, I was hesitant to say the least. But ever since I was a kid, I have always been determined to take on big challenges that might seem daughting at the begining. So I took the course next year too. It was only at the end of grade 10, when I started to reflect on the challenges I was facing and the mistakes I was making trying to program, that I strated to get a real grip on this new material. After deciding not to quit, looking into myself into ways to improve and then implemting those lessons was it then that I gained confidence in programming. After that, I've taken these lessons to heart in the years that came, when ever a task seemed doungting at first, I would assess the situation, find a solution and the act on it. I am glad to say that because that grade 10 course, I was able to achieve success in university as well and hope to continue that during the summer coop work term.
